--This is an example of some SQL queries that I use to view monthly costs and inventory.
--The data queried was downloaded directly from company database.

--How many jobs are open for each customer?
SELECT DISTINCT customer, COUNT(job) AS open_jobs

GROUP BY customer
ORDER BY open_jobs DESC;

-- What are the oldest jobs?
--Since SQLite does not have a date type, I search by the year first.

FROM activejobs
JOIN costreport
ON activejobs.job = costreport.job
WHERE order_date LIKE '%2021'

-- How many hours have not been billed for? We will review these jobs.
SELECT activejobs.job, costreport.hours, activejobs.description
FROM activejobs
JOIN costreport
ON activejobs.job = costreport.job
WHERE hours > 0
ORDER BY hours DESC;

--How much material and services have not been billed for per job?
SELECT activejobs.job, costreport.material,costreport.osp, activejobs.description,
material + osp AS total_cost
FROM activejobs
JOIN costreport
ON activejobs.job = costreport.job
WHERE total_cost > 0

--How much material and services have not been billed for total?
SELECT SUM(material) + SUM(osp) AS open_cost
