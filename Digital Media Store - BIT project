For this project, I was provided a file with 11 tables that represented a digital media store.
Below are some questions and queries I ran to find the information I wanted.

--How many customers are there?
SELECT COUNT(CustomerId)
FROM chinook.customers;
--59 customers

--What country has the most listeners? Show top 5.
SELECT COUNT(Country), Country
FROM chinook.customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY COUNT(Country) DESC
LIMIT 5;
--1. USA 2. Canada 3. France 4. Brazil 5. Germany

--Show invoices from country with most customers.
SELECT inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.Total, inv.CustomerId, inv.BillingCountry, cust.Country
FROM chinook.invoices inv
JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId
WHERE cust.Country = 'USA'
ORDER BY inv.Total DESC;

--What country are the top 10 customers from bases on invoice total?
SELECT cust.Country, SUM(inv.Total)

LIMIT 10;

--Which customer has the largest invoice total?
SELECT cust.CustomerId, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, Max(inv.Total)
