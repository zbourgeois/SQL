--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone';

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT customers.acctnum, feb.Product, feb.Quantity
FROM BIT_DB.customers customers
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON customers.order_id=feb.orderID
ORDER BY customers.acctnum;

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY price LIMIT 1;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product,price,SUM(Quantity),
(price * SUM(Quantity)) Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, Quantity, Location, SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(cust.acctnum) customer_count, AVG(feb.Quantity*feb.price) avg_spent
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
